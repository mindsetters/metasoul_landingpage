<h2 id="einleitung-ueberblick-en" class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36px">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">We have written this privacy policy (version 22.09.2021-111834433) in order to explain to you, in accordance with the provisions of the <a class="adsimple-111834433" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&amp;amp%3Btid=%5Badsimpletextid]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a> and applicable national laws, which personal data (data for short) we as the controller &ndash; and the processors commissioned by us (e.g. providers) &ndash; process, will process in the future and what legal options you have. The terms used are to be considered as gender-neutral.<br /><strong class="adsimple-111834433">In short:</strong> We provide you with comprehensive information about any personal data we process about you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal terminology. However, this privacy policy is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. So long as it aids transparency, technical <strong class="adsimple-111834433">terms are explained in a reader-friendly manner, links</strong> to further information are provided and <strong class="adsimple-111834433">graphics</strong> are used. We are thus informing in clear and simple language that we only process personal data in the context of our business activities if there is a legal basis for it. This is certainly not possible with brief, unclear and legal-technical statements, as is often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative. Maybe you will also find some information that you have not been familiar with.<br />If you still have questions, we would like to ask you to contact the responsible body named below or in the imprint, to follow the existing links and to look at further information on third-party sites. You can of course also find our contact details in the imprint.</p>
<h2 id="anwendungsbereich-en" class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36px">Scope</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by our company and to all personal data processed by companies commissioned by us (processors). With the term personal data, we refer to information within the meaning of Article 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as the name, email address and postal address of a person. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and invoice our services and products, be it online or offline. The scope of this privacy policy includes:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-111834433" style="text-align: left;">
<li class="adsimple-111834433">all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate</li>
<li class="adsimple-111834433">Social media presences and email communication</li>
<li class="adsimple-111834433">mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong class="adsimple-111834433">In short:</strong> This privacy policy applies to all areas in which personal data is processed in a structured manner by the company via the channels mentioned. Should we enter into legal relations with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.</p>
<h2 id="rechtsgrundlagen-en" class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36px">Legal bases</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the following privacy policy, we provide you with transparent information on the legal principles and regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which enable us to process personal data.<br />Whenever EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of April 27, 2016. You can of course access the General Data Protection Regulation of the EU online at EUR-Lex, the gateway to EU law, at <a class="adsimple-111834433" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&amp;tid=111834433" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li class="adsimple-111834433"><strong class="adsimple-111834433">Consent</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be the storage of data you entered into a contact form.</li>
<li class="adsimple-111834433"><strong class="adsimple-111834433">Contract</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR): We process your data in order to fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you. For example, if we conclude a sales contract with you, we need personal information in advance.</li>
<li class="adsimple-111834433"><strong class="adsimple-111834433">Legal obligation</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we will process your data. For example, we are legally required to keep invoices for our bookkeeping. These usually contain personal data.</li>
<li class="adsimple-111834433"><strong class="adsimple-111834433">Legitimate interests</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR): In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your basic rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we have to process certain data in order to be able to operate our website securely and economically. Therefore, the processing is a legitimate interest.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other conditions such as making recordings in the interest of the public, the exercise of official authority as well as the protection of vital interests do not usually occur with us. Should such a legal basis be relevant, it will be disclosed in the appropriate place.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-111834433" style="text-align: left;">
<li class="adsimple-111834433">In <strong class="adsimple-111834433">Austria</strong> this is the Austrian Data Protection Act (<strong class="adsimple-111834433">Datenschutzgesetz</strong>), in short <strong class="adsimple-111834433">DSG</strong>.</li>
<li class="adsimple-111834433">In <strong class="adsimple-111834433">Germany</strong> this is the Federal Data Protection Act (<strong class="adsimple-111834433">Bundesdatenschutzgesetz</strong>), in short <strong class="adsimple-111834433">BDSG</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Should other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.</p>
<h2 id="speicherdauer-en" class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36px">Storage Period</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is a general criterion for us to store personal data only for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as any reason for the data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to keep certain data stored even after the original purpose no longer exists, such as for accounting purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you want your data to be deleted or if you want to revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as soon as possible, provided there is no obligation to continue its storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We will inform you below about the specific duration of the respective data processing, provided we have further information.</p>
<h2 id="rechte-dsgvo-en" class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36px">Rights in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">You are granted the following rights in accordance with the provisions of the <a class="adsimple-111834433" href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDPR</a> (General Data Protection Regulation) and the Austrian <a class="adsimple-111834433" href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1999_1_165/ERV_1999_1_165.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Protection Act (DSG)</a>:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-111834433" style="text-align: left;">
<li class="adsimple-111834433">right to rectification (article 16 GDPR)</li>
<li class="adsimple-111834433">right to erasure (&ldquo;right to be forgotten&ldquo;) (article 17 GDPR)</li>
<li class="adsimple-111834433">right to restrict processing (article 18 GDPR)</li>

<li class="adsimple-111834433">right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing &ndash; including profiling &ndash; (article 22 GDPR)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you think that the processing of your data violates the data protection law, or that your data protection rights have been infringed in any other way, you can lodge a complaint with your respective regulatory authority. For Austria this is the data protection authority, whose website you can access at <a class="adsimple-111834433" href="https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/?tid=111834433">https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">We only transfer or process data to countries outside the EU (third countries) if you consent to this processing, if this is required by law or if it is contractually necessary. In any case, we generally only do so to the permitted extent. In most cases, your consent is the most important reason for data being processed in third countries. When personal data is being processed in third countries such as the USA, where many software manufacturers offer their services and have their servers located, your personal data may be processed and stored in unexpected ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We want to expressly point out, that according to the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfer to the USA. Data processing by US services (such as Google Analytics) may result in data processing and retention without the data having undergone anonymisation processes. Furthermore, US government authorities may be able to access individual data. The collected data may also get linked to data from other services of the same provider, should you have a user account with the respective provider. We try to use server locations within the EU, whenever this is offered and possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We will provide you with more details about data transfer to third countries in the appropriate sections of this privacy policy, whenever applicable.</p>
<h2 id="sicherheit-datenverarbeitung-en" class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36px">Security of data processing operations</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In order to protect personal data, we have implemented both technical and organisational measures. We encrypt or pseudonymise personal data wherever this is possible. Thus, we make it as difficult as we can for third parties to extract personal information from our data.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Article 25 of the GDPR refers to &ldquo;data protection by technical design and by data protection-friendly default&rdquo; which means that both software (e.g. forms) and hardware (e.g. access to server rooms) appropriate safeguards and security measures shall always be placed. If applicable, we will outline the specific measures below.</p>
<h2 id="tls-verschluesselung-https-en" class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36px">TLS encryption with https</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The terms TLS, encryption and https sound very technical, which they are indeed. We use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to securely transfer data on the Internet.<br />This means that the entire transmission of all data from your browser to our web server is secured &ndash; nobody can &ldquo;listen in&rdquo;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We have thus introduced an additional layer of security and meet privacy requirements through technology design <a class="adsimple-111834433" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN&amp;tid=111834433" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Article 25 Section 1 GDPR</a>). With the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is an encryption protocol for safe data transfer on the internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential information.<br />You can recognise the use of this safeguarding tool by the little lock-symbol <img role="img" src="https://www.adsimple.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/schlosssymbol-https-211141072.svg" width="17" height="18" />, which is situated in your browser&rsquo;s top left corner in the left of the internet address (e.g. examplepage.uk), as well as by the display of the letters https (instead of http) as a part of our web address.<br />If you want to know more about encryption, we recommend you to do a Google search for &ldquo;Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure wiki&rdquo; to find good links to further information.</p>

<h3 class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="31.5px">What are cookies?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our website uses HTTP-cookies to store user-specific data.<br />In the following we explain what cookies are and why they are used, so that you can better understand the following privacy policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whenever you surf the Internet, you are using a browser. Common browsers are for example, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text-files in your browser. These files are called cookies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is important to note that cookies are very useful little helpers. Almost every website uses cookies. More precisely, these are HTTP cookies, as there are also other cookies for other uses. HTTP cookies are small files that our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are automatically placed into the cookie-folder, which is the &ldquo;brain&rdquo; of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. Moreover, to define a cookie, one or multiple attributes must be specified.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cookies store certain user data about you, such as language or personal page settings. When you re-open our website to visit again, your browser submits these &ldquo;user-related&rdquo; information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are familiar to. In some browsers, each cookie has its own file, while in others, such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The following graphic shows a possible interaction between a web browser such as Chrome and the web server. The web browser requests a website and receives a cookie back from the server. The browser then uses this again as soon as another page is requested.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img role="img" src="https://www.adsimple.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/http-cookie-interaction.svg" alt="HTTP cookie interaction between browser and web server" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, while third-party cookies are created by partner-websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Each cookie must be evaluated individually, as each cookie stores different data. The expiry time of a cookie also varies from a few minutes to a few years. Cookies are not software programs and do not contain viruses, trojans or other malware. Cookies also cannot access your PC&rsquo;s information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is an example of how cookie-files can look:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong class="adsimple-111834433">Name:</strong> _ga<br /><strong class="adsimple-111834433">Value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152111834433-9<br /><strong class="adsimple-111834433">Purpose:</strong> Differentiation between website visitors<br /><strong class="adsimple-111834433">Expiry date:</strong> after 2 years</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A browser should support these minimum sizes:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-111834433" style="text-align: left;">
<li class="adsimple-111834433">At least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>
<li class="adsimple-111834433">At least 50 cookies per domain</li>
<li class="adsimple-111834433">At least 3000 cookies in total</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="31.5px">Which types of cookies are there?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The exact cookies that we use, depend on the used services, which will be outlined in the following sections of this privacy policy. Firstly, we will briefly focus on the different types of HTTP-cookies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are 4 different types of cookies:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong class="adsimple-111834433"> Essential cookies<br /></strong> These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic functions of a website. They are needed when a user for example puts a product into their shopping cart, then continues surfing on different websites and comes back later in order to proceed to the checkout. These cookies ensure the shopping cart does not get deleted, even if the user closes their browser window.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong class="adsimple-111834433"> Purposive cookies<br /></strong> These cookies collect information about user behaviour and whether the user receives any error messages. Furthermore, these cookies record the website&rsquo;s loading time as well as its behaviour in different browsers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong class="adsimple-111834433"> Target-orientated cookies<br /></strong> These cookies ensure better user-friendliness. Thus, information such as previously entered locations, fonts sizes or data in forms stay stored.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong class="adsimple-111834433"> Advertising cookies<br /></strong>These cookies are also known as targeting cookies. They serve the purpose of delivering customised advertisements to the user. This can be very practical, but also rather annoying.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Upon your first visit to a website you are usually asked which of these cookie-types you want to accept. Furthermore, this decision will of course also be stored in a cookie.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you want to learn more about cookies and do not mind technical documentation, we recommend <a class="adsimple-111834433" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265</a>, the Request for Comments of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called &ldquo;HTTP State Management Mechanism&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="31.5px">Purpose of processing via cookies</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The purpose ultimately depends on the respective cookie. You can find out more details below or from the software manufacturer that sets the cookie.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="31.5px">Which data are processed?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cookies are little helpers for a wide variety of tasks. Unfortunately, it is not possible to tell which data is generally stored in cookies, but in the privacy policy below we will inform you on what data is processed or stored.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="31.5px">Storage period of cookies</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The storage period depends on the respective cookie and is further specified below. Some cookies are erased after less than an hour, while others can remain on a computer for several years.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can also influence the storage duration yourself. You can manually erase all cookies at any time in your browser (also see &ldquo;Right of objection&rdquo; below).

<p style="text-align: left;">If you generally do not want cookies, you can set up your browser in a way to notify you whenever a cookie is about to be set. This gives you the opportunity to manually decide to either permit or deny the placement of every single cookie. This procedure varies depending on the browser. Therefore, it might be best for you to search for the instructions in Google. If you are using Chrome, you could for example put the search term &ldquo;delete cookies Chrome&rdquo; or &ldquo;deactivate cookies Chrome&rdquo; into Google.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="31.5px">Legal basis</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The so-called &ldquo;cookie directive&rdquo; has existed since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies requires your <strong class="adsimple-111834433">consent</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR). Within countries of the EU, however, the reactions to these guidelines still vary greatly. In Austria, however, this directive was implemented in Section 96 (3) of the Telecommunications Act (TKG). In Germany, the cookie guidelines have not been implemented as national law. Instead, this guideline was largely implemented in Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For absolutely necessary cookies, even if no consent has been given, there are legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR), which in most cases are of an economic nature. We want to offer our visitors a pleasant user experience on our website. For this, certain cookies often are absolutely necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is exclusively done with your consent, unless absolutely necessary cookies are used. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (a) of the GDPR.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the following sections you will find more detail on the use of cookies, provided the used software does use cookies.</p>

<h3 class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="31.5px">What is Email-Marketing?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">We use email marketing to keep you up to date. If you have agreed to receive our emails or newsletters, your data will be processed and stored. Email marketing is a part of online marketing. In this type of marketing, news or general information about a company, product or service are emailed to a specific group of people who are interested in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you want to participate in our email marketing (usually via newsletter), you usually just have to register with your email address. To do this, you have to fill in and submit an online form. However, we may also ask you for your title and name, so we can address you personally in our emails.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The registration for newsletters generally works with the help of the so-called &ldquo;double opt-in procedure&rdquo;. After you have registered for our newsletter on our website, you will receive an email, via which you can confirm the newsletter registration. This ensures that you own the email address you signed up with, and prevents anyone to register with a third-party email address. We or a notification tool we use, will log every single registration. This is necessary so we can ensure and prove, that registration processes are done legally and correctly. In general, the time of registration and registration confirmation are stored, as well as your IP address. Moreover, any change you make to your data that we have on file is also logged.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="31.5px">Why do we use Email-Marketing?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course, we want to stay in contact with you and keep you in the loop of the most important news about our company. For this, we use email marketing &ndash; often just referred to as &ldquo;newsletters&rdquo; &ndash; as an essential part of our online marketing. If you agree to this or if it is permitted by law, we will send you newsletters, system emails or other notifications via email. Whenever the term &ldquo;newsletter&rdquo; is used in the following text, it mainly refers to emails that are sent regularly. We of course don&rsquo;t want to bother you with our newsletter in any way. Thus, we genuinely strive to offer only relevant and interesting content. In our emails you can e.g. find out more about our company and our services or products. Since we are continuously improving our offer, our newsletter will always give you the latest news, or special, lucrative promotions. Should we commission a service provider for our email marketing, who offers a professional mailing tool, we do this in order to offer you fast and secure newsletters. The purpose of our email marketing is to inform you about new offers and also to get closer to our business goals.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="31.5px">Which data are processed?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you subscribe to our newsletter via our website, you then have to confirm your membership in our email list via an email that we will send to you. In addition to your IP and email address, your name, address and telephone number may also be stored. However, this will only be done if you agree to this data retention. Any data marked as such are necessary so you can participate in the offered service. Giving this information is voluntary, but failure to provide it will prevent you from using this service. Moreover, information about your device or the type of content you prefer on our website may also be stored. In the section &ldquo;Automatic data storage&rdquo; you can find out more about how your data is stored when you visit a website.&nbsp;We record your informed consent, so we can always prove that it complies with our laws.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="31.5px">Duration of data processing</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you unsubscribe from our e-mail/newsletter distribution list, we may store your address for up to three years on the basis of our legitimate interests, so we can keep proof your consent at the time. We are only allowed to process this data if we have to defend ourselves against any claims.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, if you confirm that you have given us your consent to subscribe to the newsletter, you can submit an individual request for erasure at any time. Furthermore, if you permanently object to your consent, we reserve the right to store your email address in a blacklist. But as long as you have voluntarily subscribed to our newsletter, we will of course keep your email address on file.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="31.5px">Withdrawal &ndash; how can I cancel my subscription?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">You have the option to cancel your newsletter subscription at any time. All you have to do is revoke your consent to the newsletter subscription. This usually only takes a few seconds or a few clicks. Most of the time you will find a link at the end of every email, via which you will be able to cancel the subscription. Should you not be able to find the link in the newsletter, you can contact us by email and we will immediately cancel your newsletter subscription for you.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111834433 fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="31.5px">Legal basis</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our newsletter is sent on the basis of your <strong class="adsimple-111834433"> consent </strong> (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). This means that we are only allowed to send you a newsletter if you have actively registered for it beforehand. Moreover, we may also send you advertising messages on the basis of Section 7 (3) UWG (Unfair Competition Act), provided you have become our customer and have not objected to the use of your email address for direct mail.</p>
